# Grocery-Store-Management---SQL-Project
A complete end-to-end SQL project where I designed a relational database for a grocery store, created 7 interconnected tables, cleaned and formatted data, and wrote analytical SQL queries to uncover insights on customers, products, suppliers, employees, and sales trends. Includes schema design, ER diagram, analysis queries, and business insights.
